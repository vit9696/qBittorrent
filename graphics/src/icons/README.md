# qBittorrent Icons

## Previous
Old icons were created by Bert Verhelst (<verhelstbert@gmail.com>).
Icons were based on the [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) icon set.

## Redesign
Redesigned icons has been created by Nowshed H. Imran (<nowshed.imran@gmail.com>). There are some additional icons available in [flow-icon](https://github.com/nowshed-imran/flow-icon) repository that can be used in future development.
New icons are based on [la-capitaine-icon-theme](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme) and [ionicons](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionicons).
`la-capitaine` project is owned by Keefer Rourke and due permission was received before modifying them.
`ionicons` project is under MIT license and thus it can be used freely.
Both of these projects can be used as reference for future icon designs.

## Color Reference
