qBittorrent for macOS 10.14+ Dark mode with its theme modded to actually adhear to macOS environment.

For the light themed version select the "masters" branch.

Most of the graphics used is from [La Capitaine icon pack](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme).

Webui Dark theme from https://github.com/iFelix18/Dark-qBittorrent-WebUI .

These releases are pure alpha with everything, incl. the dependencies, built from development sources thanks to a [script by Kolcha](https://gist.github.com/Kolcha/3ccd533123b773ba110b8fd778b1c2bf). If something doesn't work - I cannot help you.

Apart from the graphics there are two other differences from the original: sequential download is enabled by default and the version reported to the tracker is faked to be stable (according to the current stable official at the time of build).
