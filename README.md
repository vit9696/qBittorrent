[qBittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent) for macOS 10.15+ modded to actually adhear to macOS environment.

Most of the graphics used is from [La Capitaine icon pack](https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme).

Apart from the UI there are two differences from the original: sequential download is enabled by default and the version reported to the tracker is faked to be stable (according to the current official stable at the time of build).
